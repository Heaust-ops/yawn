# yawn
yet another webgl ngine

## accepted plans
- most of the logic in service workers
- ts / webgl based
- as declarative as possible
- no backwards compatibility until v1.0
- as much geometric algebra as reasonable

## planned milestone

- connect events from main thread to service worker
- share canvas b/w sw
- render triangle

## Goal: All the good algorithms
What algorithms are we planning to have,
- gpu picking?
- HZB occlusion + frustum/portal culling?
- deferred + forward lighting?
- hair/fur support?
- splines?
- good auto lod (how?)
- auto billboarding?
- selective raytracing? (maybe to bake static lighting on init?)
- Global Illumination? (how?)
- postprocesses?
- physics?
- simulations? (fluid, cloth, rigid body)
- g-splats?
- volumetrics? (openvdb?)
- edge detection?
- SDFs?
- animation/bones?

## are we gon use ogl or start from scratch?
